**Describe the bug**
Once stepping over the exit door sprite, kittens should be rescued or not rescued, 
depending on how many the player currently has collected. Instead, the kittens rescued counter always increments by one,
no matter how many kittens are held, 0 or more.

**To Reproduce**
1. Player steps over exit door with or without kittens rescued.

**Expected behavior**
Kittens rescued counter to properly count how many kittens are held at time of crossing exit door sprite.
